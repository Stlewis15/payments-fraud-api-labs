# payments-fraud-api-labs

Hands-on API labs focused on payment processing, fraud prevention, and Sales Engineer fundamentals.

This repository is part of **Payment Bootcamp 01**, a structured, hands-on learning track designed to build real-world experience with payment APIs, Postman, webhooks, and fraud-related workflows used by companies like Stripe, Visa, PayPal, and CyberSource.

## Why this repo exists
This repo is intentionally **hands-on and practical**, mirroring how Sales Engineers:
- Test APIs with customers
- Troubleshoot integration issues
- Explain request/response behavior clearly
- Build repeatable demos using Postman environments

Each lab includes documentation and screenshots to demonstrate both technical execution and SE-style communication.
